# Smart Footwear for the Visually Impaired

Developed an assistive wearable device that detects obstacles in real-time and alerts the user using vibration and sound. The system uses ultrasonic sensors integrated into footwear to detect obstacles in the walking path and provides intuitive feedback. Features an automatic battery charging system for better usability.

## 🧠 Project Overview:
This work includes two assistive systems working together:

## 👟 1. Smart Footwear (Obstacle Detection + Piezoelectric Charging)
- Detects front-side obstacles using an Ultrasonic Sensor
- Alerts the user via Vibration Motor and Buzzer
- Powered by a Rechargeable Battery, charged using a Piezoelectric Sensor
- The Piezoelectric sensor captures pressure from foot movement and converts it to electricity using a Bridge Rectifier, which charges the internal battery
- Helps the user detect close-range obstacles while walking

## 👕 2. Chest-Mounted Ground Dip Detection System
- A separate chest-mounted device detects ground dips or steps down (like potholes or stairs)
- When a sudden drop is detected ahead, the system triggers a sound alert
- This helps users anticipate changes in ground level and avoid tripping
- Improves vertical awareness where normal foot sensors may not detect depth reliably

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Arduino Nano (ATmega328P)
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
- Piezoelectric Sensor
- Bridge Rectifier Module
- Vibration Motor + Buzzer
- Embedded C (Arduino IDE)
- Rechargeable Battery System

## 🧠 Features
- Detects obstacles using ultrasonic sensor
- Alerts via vibration and sound
- Wearable design
- Auto-recharge circuit
